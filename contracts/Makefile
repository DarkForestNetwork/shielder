# Brownie compiles each solidity source file only when it has changed.
# If contract A depends on contract B, and we change B in an
# incompatible way, A will not be recompiled when we run 'brownie
# test' or 'brownie compile' and it will even run the tests with the
# cached compilation output of A.
#
# This Makefile makes sure we always recompile all contracts.
